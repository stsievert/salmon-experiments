This repository implements experiments on Salmon. For a description of Salmon,
see the following links:

* https://docs.stsievert.com/salmon/
* https://github.com/stsievert/salmon

This repo has the following experiments:

* `alien-eggs/`, which is a synthetic simulation that uses a human noise
  model derived from previously collected responses.

* (TODO) `zappos`, which uses the Zappos shoe dataset.

* (TODO) crowdsourcing Salmon.

See each directory for details on how I ran each experiment.
