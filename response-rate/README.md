These experiments were generated by the following process:

* **Simulating human responses**
    1. Launch Salmon
    2. Run `run.py` twice (with `max_queries`/`alg` keys; see comments in
    script).
    3. Download responses from Salmon (they're also written to disk by
    `run.py`)
* **Generate embeddings**
    * Run `generate-embeddings.py` (which requires changing the directory
    of the IO directory)
    * `generate-embeddings.py` was run on a cluster, so I ran `make up` then
      ran `generate-embeddings.py` on the cluster, then downloaded the
      generated embedding files to `io/[date]`.
* **Visualize** with the Jupyter notebook `Viz.ipynb`.
